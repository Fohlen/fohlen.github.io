Hi there! I am a Cognitive Scientist interested in the mechanisms underpinning (human and machine) learning. 

My tinkering is primarily done in Python (üêç), which helps me prototype very quickly. My colleagues call me a _"professional thing breaker"_. Other than that I'm agnostic - most any problem deserves its own solution.

## Work

Presently I work for [YUKKA Lab](https://www.yukkalab.com), a news analytics company, as the data engineering team lead of a fantastic group of people. We are aiming to create a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire world.
Before I've worked with the great folks at [yWorks](https://www.yworks.com) and [mecodia](https://mecodia.de).
