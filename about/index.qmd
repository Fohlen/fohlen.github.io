Hi there! I am a Cognitive Scientist interested in the mechanisms underpinning (human and machine) learning. 

My tinkering is primarily done in Python üêç, which helps me prototype very quickly. My colleagues call me a _"professional thing breaker"_. Other than that I'm agnostic - most any problem deserves its own solution.

## Work

I work on the [ARC AGI challenge](https://arcprize.org/arc-agi) at [Martin Butz](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/cognitive-modeling/)'s lab, attempting to solve iterative planning problems in AI.

Previously I worked at [YUKKA Lab](https://www.yukkalab.com), a news analytics company, as the data engineering team lead of a fantastic group of people. 
We created a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire world and a named entity linking system to disambiguate everything.

Before that I've worked with the great folks at [yWorks](https://www.yworks.com) and [mecodia](https://mecodia.de).
