abstract="Markov chains are convenient means of generating realizations of networks with a given (joint or otherwise) degree distribution, since they simply require a procedure for rewiring edges. The major challenge is to find the right number of steps to run such a chain, so that we generate truly independent samples. Theoretical bounds for mixing times of these Markov chains are too large to be practically useful. Practitioners have no useful guide for choosing the length, and tend to pick numbers fairly arbitrarily. We give a principled mathematical argument showing that it suffices for the length to be proportional to the number of desired number of edges. We also prescribe a method for choosing this proportionality constant. We run a series of experiments showing that the distributions of common graph properties converge in this time, providing empirical evidence for our claims.",

abstract = {A basic property of a network node is its degree, or the number of connections it has with other nodes. Degree is not distributed homogeneously across the nodes of brain networks; instead, some nodes have a very high degree, marking them as putative network hubs. Characterizing the distribution of degree across nodes is, therefore, an important component of any network analysis. In this chapter, we define node degree for directed and undirected networks, and consider its weighted analogue, node strength. We discuss different types of network degree distribution, focusing on the distinction between single-scale, scale-free (i.e., power-law), and broad-scale networks, and examine appropriate methods for their characterization. We also consider studies examining the distribution of connectivity weights in brain networks, focusing in particular on evidence that these weights have a lognormal distribution.}
