I am a computational linguist interested in the mechanisms underpinning (human and machine) learning. 

My tinkering is primarily done in üêç, which I firmly believe to have one of the most productive standard libraries to date. Other than that most any problem deserves its own solution.

Presently I work for [YUKKA Lab](https://www.yukkalab.com), a news analytics company, as the data engineering team lead of a fantastic group of people, where we are aiming to create a comprehensive knowledge graph of the world.
Before I've worked with the great folks at [yWorks](https://www.yworks.com) and [mecodia](https://mecodia.de).
